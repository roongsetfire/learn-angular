    <p class="t1"> Our product solves the problem with the lack of fast, context-specific and most importantly - untampered help out there.
    <p class="t1">solve that problem for our users by providing them an instant and specific help from people that may have already walked the same path and bought the same product.</p>
    <p class="t1">So next time, when you visit a site and you can't find a review or an answer that satisfies your information needs, you can open up our chat widget and ask a non-formal question to one of our helpers.</p>
